    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

## Installation

```bash
npm install @stdlib/strided-base-offset-view
```

Alternatively,

-   To load the package in a website via a `script` tag without installation and bundlers, use the [ES Module][es-module] available on the [`esm`][esm-url] branch (see [README][esm-readme]).
-   If you are using Deno, visit the [`deno`][deno-url] branch (see [README][deno-readme] for usage intructions).
-   For use in Observable, or in browser/node environments, use the [Universal Module Definition (UMD)][umd] build available on the [`umd`][umd-url] branch (see [README][umd-readme]).

The [branches.md][branches-url] file summarizes the available branches and displays a diagram illustrating their relationships.

To view installation and usage instructions specific to each branch build, be sure to explicitly navigate to the respective README files on each branch, as linked to above.

## Usage

```javascript
var offsetView = require( '@stdlib/strided-base-offset-view' );
```

#### offsetView( x, offset )

Returns a typed array view having the same data type as a provided input typed array and starting at a specified index offset.

```javascript
var Float64Array = require( '@stdlib/array-float64' );

var x = new Float64Array( 10 );

var view = offsetView( x, 0 );
// returns <Float64Array>

var bool = ( view.buffer === x.buffer );
// returns true

var len = view.length;
// returns 10
```

The `offset` argument specifies the starting index of the returned typed array view relative to the input array `x`.

```javascript
var Float64Array = require( '@stdlib/array-float64' );

var x = new Float64Array( [ 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0 ] );

var view = offsetView( x, 2 );
// returns <Float64Array>

var len = view.length;
// returns 6

var v1 = view[ 0 ];
// returns 3.0

var v2 = view[ 1 ];
// returns 4.0
```

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var Float64Array = require( '@stdlib/array-float64' );
var offsetView = require( '@stdlib/strided-base-offset-view' );

// Define a typed array:
var x = new Float64Array( [ 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0 ] );
// returns <Float64Array>

// Create a view of the array:
var view = offsetView( x, 0 );
// returns <Float64Array>

// Set view elements:
view[ 0 ] = 9.0;
view[ 1 ] = 10.0;

// Get the first two elements of the original array:
var v0 = x[ 0 ];
// returns 9.0

var v1 = x[ 1 ];
// returns 10.0
```
